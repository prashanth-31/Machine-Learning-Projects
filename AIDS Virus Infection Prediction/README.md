* Dataset contains healthcare statistics and categorical information about patients who have been diagnosed with AIDS. 
This dataset was initially published in 1996.

### Attribute Information :
1. time: time to failure or censoring
2. trt: treatment indicator (0 = ZDV only; 1 = ZDV + ddI, 2 = ZDV + Zal, 3 = ddI only)
3. age: age (yrs) at baseline
4. wtkg: weight (kg) at baseline
5. hemo: hemophilia (0=no, 1=yes)
6. homo: homosexual activity (0=no, 1=yes)
7. drugs: history of IV drug use (0=no, 1=yes)
8. karnof: Karnofsky score (on a scale of 0-100)
9. oprior: Non-ZDV antiretroviral therapy pre-175 (0=no, 1=yes)
10. z30: ZDV in the 30 days prior to 175 (0=no, 1=yes)
11. preanti: days pre-175 anti-retroviral therapy
12. race: race (0=White, 1=non-white)
13. gender: gender (0=F, 1=M)
14. str2: antiretroviral history (0=naive, 1=experienced)
15. strat: antiretroviral history stratification (1='Antiretroviral Naive',2='> 1 but <= 52 weeks of prior antiretroviral therapy',3='> 52 weeks)
16. symptom: symptomatic indicator (0=asymp, 1=symp)
17. treat: treatment indicator (0=ZDV only, 1=others)
18. offtrt: indicator of off-trt before 96+/-5 weeks (0=no,1=yes)
19. cd40: CD4 at baseline
20. cd420: CD4 at 20+/-5 weeks
21. cd80: CD8 at baseline
22. cd820: CD8 at 20+/-5 weeks
23. infected: is infected with AIDS (0=No, 1=Yes)


### Additional Variable Information :
- Personal information (age, weight, race, gender, sexual activity)
* Medical history (hemophilia, history of IV drugs)
+ Treatment history (ZDV/non-ZDV treatment history)
